## Detailed Description

**Does your browser feel cluttered? Do you feel overwhelmed every time you open a new tab?**

Reclaim your focus with **Zen Task New Tab**, a minimalist productivity dashboard designed to help you do one thing at a time.

### 🌟 Why You Should Install Zen Task
Most new tab extensions bombard you with news, weather, or endless to-do lists that just add to your anxiety. Zen Task does the opposite. It clears away the noise and asks you one simple question: *"What is the most important thing to do right now?"*

By forcing you to focus on a **single active task**, Zen Task helps you:
*   **Stop Multitasking**: Commit to one goal and finish it before moving on.
*   **Reduce Anxiety**: A calm, beautiful interface that lowers your cognitive load.
*   **Stay in Flow**: Built-in tools like a Pomodoro timer keep you zoned in without needing extra apps.

### 🚀 What It Does (Key Features)

**1. Single-Task Workflow**
Forget long, intimidating lists. Zen Task highlights just **one** active task at the center of your screen. You can still queue up future tasks, but they stay out of sight until you're ready for them.

**2. Built-in Focus Timer (Pomodoro)**
No need for a separate timer app. Zen Task features a beautiful, unobtrusive circular timer right on your new tab.
*   **Focus Mode**: Default 25-minute intervals to maximize productivity.
*   **Break Mode**: Gentle reminders to take 5-minute breaks to recharge.
*   **Customizable**: Adjust durations to fit your personal workflow in Settings.

**3. Mindful Aesthetics**
Your digital environment shapes your mental state. We designed Zen Task with:
*   **Soothing Colors**: Warm sand, stone, and moss tones inspired by nature.
*   **Subtle Animations**: Gentle dust motes and breathing light effects to make your tab feel alive but peaceful.
*   **Zero Clutter**: No ads, no news feeds, no distractions.

**4. Frictionless Management**
*   **Drag & Drop**: Easily reorder tasks to prioritize your day.
*   **Quick Capture**: clear your mind by dumping tasks into the list immediately.
*   **Smart Estimates**: Optional time estimates help you plan your day better.

**Privacy First**
Zen Task runs entirely on your device. Your tasks and settings are synced via your secure Chrome account to keep them available across your devices, but they are **never** sent to our servers. We do not track your browsing history.

**Transform your new tab into a sanctuary of focus. Install Zen Task today.**
