## Detailed Description
Reclaim your focus with **Zen Task New Tab**, a minimalist productivity dashboard designed to help you do one thing at a time.

In a world of distraction, your New Tab page should be a sanctuary, not a source of chaos. Zen Task replaces the clutter with a serene, beautiful interface that encourages deep work and mindful breaks.

**Key Features:**

🎯 **Single-Task Focus**
Forget overwhelming to-do lists. Zen Task forces you to select just *one* active task to focus on. Once it's done, you can move to the next.

⏱️ **Built-in Focus Timer**
Integrated Pomodoro-style timer (customizable durations) to keep you in flow. The timer runs in the background, so you never lose track even if you switch tabs.

🔔 **Mindful Reminders**
Gentle notifications remind you to take breaks, breathe, and stretch.

✨ **Zen Aesthetics**
A calming, distraction-free design with soothing colors and subtle animations to lower anxiety and boost concentration.

**Privacy Policy:**
Zen Task runs entirely on your device. Your tasks and settings are sync via your Chrome account but are never sent to external servers. We do not track your browsing history.
